  By not providing "FindsawForceDimensionSDK.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "sawForceDimensionSDK", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "sawForceDimensionSDK" with any of the following names:

    sawForceDimensionSDKConfig.cmake
    sawforcedimensionsdk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sawForceDimensionSDK" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "sawForceDimensionSDK_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "sawForceDimensionSDK" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.


Information: code in /home/jiameng/catkin_dvrk/src/cisst-saw/sawForceDimensionSDK/examples will not be compiled, it requires sawForceDimensionSDK and cisstQt
