CMake Warning (dev) at cmake/cisstMacros.cmake:693 (get_target_property):
  Policy CMP0026 is not set: Disallow use of the LOCATION target property.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0026" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The LOCATION property should not be read from target "cisstDataGenerator".
  Use the target name directly with add_custom_command, or use the generator
  expression $<TARGET_FILE>, as appropriate.
